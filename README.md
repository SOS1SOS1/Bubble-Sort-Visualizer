# Bubble Sort Visualizer

This program creates a visual for what the bubble sorting algorithm does. With bubble sort values are ordered by repetitively comparing neighboring elements and swapping if needed. The process involves scanning the list and exchanging adjacent elements if theyâ€™re in the wrong order. This "bubbles" the highest value to the top. Then, it scans again, which "bubbles" the second highest value to the top. It repeats this process until all elements are sorted.
